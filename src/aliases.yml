#
# Enchantment Aliases
#
# This file can be changed allow for alternate names for each enchantment.
# I would rather type in protection than PROTECTION_ENVIROMENT when doing a command
#
# The default aliases are taken from the vanilla ids given from the minecraft wiki
# You can find those here https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchanting
#
# If you want to add your own aliases you have to get the spigot name for the enchantment.
# This can be found here https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html
#
# If enchantment are not here that could mean many things:
#  1) I forgot to update this file
#  2) The Bukkit name is the same as the Minecraft vanilla id
#
#
# A few things to note: numbers and other special characters will be ignored and spaces will be replaced with underscores.
#
#
#                          Have fun :D
